# Language Support Features - Product Requirements & Prioritization (PRP)

## Executive Summary

The Language Support features represent critical accessibility and learning enhancement tools for the multilingual reading comprehension webapp. Currently implemented as UI stubs, these features would significantly improve the educational value and user experience for children learning Korean through English reading passages.

## Problem Statement

**Current Gap**: The Language Support section exists in the UI but provides no functional value, creating user confusion and missing critical language learning opportunities.

**User Pain Points**:
- Korean learners cannot hear proper pronunciation of new vocabulary
- No visual assistance when struggling with comprehension
- Missing phonetic guidance for Korean pronunciation
- No audio support for different learning styles
- Limited accessibility for diverse learners

## Feature Analysis & Use Cases

### 🔊 **1. Phonetics** (IPA/Korean Pronunciation Guide)

**Primary Use Cases**:
- **Vocabulary Learning**: Click Korean word → Show IPA notation `[안녕] → [annyeong]`
- **Reading Support**: Hover over Korean text to see pronunciation guide
- **Quiz Integration**: Pronunciation-based quiz questions

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
interface PhoneticsConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  displayType: 'IPA' | 'simplified' | 'both';
  trigger: 'click' | 'hover' | 'toggle';
  languages: ['korean', 'english'];
}
```

**Backend Requirements**:
- Korean pronunciation API integration (Google Text-to-Speech or Azure Speech)
- IPA notation database for Korean phonemes
- Pronunciation accuracy scoring (future)

### 🎵 **2. Audio Support** (Text-to-Speech)

**Primary Use Cases**:
- **"Read to Me" Feature**: Play entire passage with proper pronunciation
- **Word-level Audio**: Click any word to hear pronunciation
- **Quiz Accessibility**: Read quiz questions and answers aloud
- **Sentence-level Practice**: Play individual sentences for repetition

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
interface AudioConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  autoPlay: boolean;
  speed: 0.5 | 0.75 | 1.0 | 1.25 | 1.5;
  voice: {
    english: 'neural-voice-en-US';
    korean: 'neural-voice-ko-KR';
  };
  visualHighlight: boolean; // Highlight words as spoken
}
```

**Backend Requirements**:
- Azure Cognitive Services Speech integration
- Audio caching for common vocabulary
- SSML markup for natural speech patterns

### 👁️ **3. Visual Context** (Comprehension Aids)

**Primary Use Cases**:
- **Quiz Hints**: Highlight relevant text when user requests hint
- **Vocabulary Tooltips**: Rich definitions with visual examples
- **Reading Focus**: Highlight current sentence during audio playback
- **Progress Visualization**: Show reading progression and vocabulary mastery

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
interface VisualContextConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  hintHighlighting: boolean;
  vocabularyTooltips: boolean;
  readingProgress: boolean;
  sentenceHighlight: boolean;
  colorScheme: 'default' | 'high-contrast' | 'dyslexia-friendly';
}
```

**Frontend Features**:
- Text highlighting with CSS animations

- **Search Support**: Find Korean words using English keyboard
- **Gradual Learning**: Progressively reduce romanization dependency

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
interface RomanizationConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  system: 'revised' | 'mccune-reischauer' | 'simple';
  displayMode: 'always' | 'hover' | 'toggle';
  fadeOut: boolean; // Gradually hide as user progresses
}
```

**Considerations**:
- Educational debate: Some experts discourage romanization dependency
- Gradual phase-out as users advance in Korean proficiency

### 📚 **5. Grammar Hints** (Structure Explanations)

**Primary Use Cases**:
- **Sentence Structure**: Explain Korean grammar patterns
- **Quiz Explanations**: Why certain answers are grammatically correct
- **Progressive Learning**: Introduce grammar concepts gradually
