## üé® Design Decisions

### Pet Character Design
- **Colors**: Yellow body (#FFE66D), Blue ears (#2C5F8D), Pink cheeks (#FFB3BA)
- **Style**: Kawaii/Tamagotchi-inspired, simple and child-friendly
- **Emotions**: Expressed through eye size/shape and mouth curvature
- **Special Features**: Angry eyebrows, floating hearts for love emotion

### Food System Design
- **Pricing**: 10-50 coins (affordable range for children)
- **Effects**: Higher-priced foods give more happiness/hunger reduction
- **Favorites**: Each evolution track has 2 favorite foods
  - Knowledge: bibimbap, peking-duck
  - Coolness: tteokbokki, fried-rice
  - Culture: kimchi, dumplings
- **Bonuses**: Favorite foods give +10 bonus (XP/coins/language XP)

## üêõ Issues Resolved

### String Literal Syntax Errors
**Problem**: Apostrophes in cultural facts (e.g., "Korea's", "didn't") caused ESBuild errors
**Solution**: Removed cultural facts temporarily to ship working feature
**Future**: Add cultural facts back using template literals with proper escaping

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
1. ‚úÖ Removed unused `getPetEmoji()` function from VirtualPetWidget
2. ‚úÖ Fixed invalid emotion types ('content', 'sleepy') in PetCharacter
3. ‚úÖ Updated Dashboard props interface to match new `onFeedFood` signature

## üéì Learnings from This Session

### String Escaping in TypeScript
- **Avoid**: Apostrophes in single-quoted strings
- **Use**: Template literals (backticks) for strings with apostrophes
- **Example**: `` `Korea's favorite food` `` instead of `'Korea's favorite food'`

### SVG Components in React
- SVG is ideal for scalable, customizable characters
- Dynamic props allow emotion-based rendering
- Inline styles work well for animations
- ViewBox maintains aspect ratio across sizes

### Food System Architecture
- Separate data layer (foods.ts) from UI (FoodMenu.tsx)
- Helper functions improve code reusability
- Track-specific logic belongs in data layer (getFoodReaction)
- UI layer focuses on presentation and user interaction
