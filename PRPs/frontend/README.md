# Frontend PRPs

This directory contains Product Requirement Prompts (PRPs) for frontend development tasks.

## What is a PRP?

A PRP is a detailed implementation guide for a specific feature, containing:
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Code examples and file paths
- Validation checkpoints with sub-agent commands
- Quality gates (testing, accessibility, performance)

## How to Use PRPs

### Generate a PRP
```bash
/generate-prp docs/wireframes/dashboard.md
```
