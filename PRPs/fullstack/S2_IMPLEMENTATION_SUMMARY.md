**Purpose**: Choose-your-own-adventure with story branches
**Estimated Time**: 2 weeks (80 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM (Innovation feature)

**Key Features**:
- Interactive decision points in stories
- Multiple story paths (non-destructive branching)
- Branch tree visualization
- Compare different story outcomes
- AI-generated story continuations

**Tech Stack**:
- S2.dev branching API
- React Flow for tree visualization
- Azure OpenAI for story generation

---

## 🎯 Why This Order?

### Analytics First (Recommended)
✅ **Simpler**: Linear event stream (no branching complexity)
✅ **Foundation**: Creates reusable S2 infrastructure
✅ **Monetizable**: Parents pay $5/month for analytics
✅ **Lower Risk**: Non-critical feature, fails gracefully
✅ **Learning Curve**: Master S2 basics before advanced features

### Branching Second
✅ **Reuses 80%**: S2Service, event tracking, UI patterns
✅ **Faster**: 2 weeks instead of 4 weeks
✅ **Builds On**: Analytics infrastructure already in place
✅ **Advanced**: Uses S2 branching features

## 📊 Code Reuse Analysis

### Shared Infrastructure (80% reuse)

**Backend**:
```javascript
// S2Service base class
class S2Service {
  appendEvent()      // ✅ Used by both
  readSession()      // ✅ Used by both
  subscribeToSession() // ✅ Used by both
  
  // Branching-specific (new)
  createBranch()     // ❌ Only branching
  listBranches()     // ❌ Only branching
}
```

**Frontend**:
```typescript
// Event tracking
analyticsService.trackEvent()  // ✅ Used by both
analyticsService.flushEvents() // ✅ Used by both

// Timeline visualization
<Timeline events={events} />   // ✅ Used by both (70% reuse)

// Context patterns
useAnalytics()                 // ✅ Pattern reused
useBranchingStory()            // ✅ Same pattern
```

**Types**:
```typescript
// Event types
BaseReadingEvent               // ✅ Used by both
WordClickEvent                 // ✅ Used by both
PauseEvent                     // ✅ Used by both

// Branching-specific
DecisionPoint                  // ❌ Only branching
BranchTree                     // ❌ Only branching
```

## 💰 Business Value

### Analytics Dashboard
**Revenue Potential**: $5/month × 1000 users = $5,000/month = $60,000/year
**Development Cost**: 2 weeks × $100/hour × 40 hours = $8,000
**ROI**: Break even in 1.6 months
**User Impact**: HIGH (parents want progress tracking)

### Branching Stories
**Revenue Potential**: $3/month × 500 users = $1,500/month = $18,000/year
**Development Cost**: 2 weeks × $100/hour × 40 hours = $8,000
**ROI**: Break even in 5.3 months
**User Impact**: HIGH (students love interactive stories)

**Combined**: $78,000/year revenue, $16,000 development cost

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Why S2.dev?
✅ **Durable streams**: Events persist forever
✅ **Event sourcing**: Natural fit for analytics
✅ **Branching**: Built-in feature (no custom implementation)
✅ **Scalability**: Handles unlimited subscribers
✅ **Replay**: Time-travel through events

### Alternatives Considered
- **WebSockets**: Ephemeral, need custom persistence
- **Firebase**: More expensive, less flexible
- **Supabase**: Good alternative, but no branching
- **Custom solution**: Too much infrastructure work

### Why S2.dev Wins
- **Analytics**: Event sourcing is core use case
- **Branching**: Native branching API (unique feature)
- **Cost**: Usage-based pricing scales with growth
- **Simplicity**: No WebSocket connection management

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

### Analytics Dashboard
⚠️ **Performance**: Batch events every 2 seconds (not on every interaction)
⚠️ **Storage**: S2 streams can grow large (implement cleanup strategy)
⚠️ **Privacy**: Ensure COPPA compliance (parental consent for tracking)
⚠️ **Cost**: Monitor S2 usage (set up billing alerts)

### Branching Stories
⚠️ **Complexity**: Limit branch depth to 3 levels (avoid decision paralysis)
⚠️ **AI Quality**: Story continuations may be inconsistent (add validation)
⚠️ **UI Confusion**: Branch tree can be overwhelming (provide guided mode)
⚠️ **State Management**: Branch switching requires careful state handling

- [ ] Event tracking adds <100ms overhead
- [ ] Session replay works for 100+ event sessions
- [ ] Dashboard loads in <2 seconds
- [ ] Metrics calculation accurate (±5% error)
- [ ] Parents find insights actionable (user testing)

### Branching Stories
- [ ] Branch creation takes <3 seconds
- [ ] AI continuations are coherent (90%+ quality)
